            <p>I currently work for a company called Marketing Queen Consulting, where I have a wide range of responsibilities in nearly every aspect of what the company offers. I started off as an intern where I mostly wrote and scheduled social media posts for clients which pertained to their latest blog posts. I did a very light portion of web development, SEO and blog creation using WordPress and Shopify during this time as well, along with other random tasks that were required at a given time such as quarterly reports and press submissions.</p>

            <h3 class="orange-color">2021-2022 | Delwar IT</h3>
            <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a Digital Marketer. I made their website SEO and showed
                it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Delwar IT.</p>
